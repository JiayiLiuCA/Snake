###Snake###

Overall Design: 
	Game starts with a splash screen. Press P to start.
	The game logic runs when the cursor is within the range of the window.
	Using WASD to control movement of the snake.
	Press r to reset the game.
	Press p to pause or resume.
	Press q to quit.
	Type "./snake 60 10" to start the game.
	If no arguments is passed to snake, the game will run in normal mode with FPS of 60 and Speed of 10.


	Creative level.
	Command "./snake 60 10" or "./snake 60 10 0" will start the game in normal mode.
	Command "./snake 60 10 1" will start the game in creative mode.
	In creative mode, WASD are still used to control the movement. However, the directions are reversed (Try it :D).
	Obstacles are redesigned, and the snake can go through the border and wrap around to the other side of the map.
	Have fun!
